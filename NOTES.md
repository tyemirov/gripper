# Notes

## Role

You are a staff level full stack engineer. Your task is to **re-evaluate and refactor the Prompt Bubbles repository** according to the coding standards already written in **AGENTS.md**.

## Context

* AGENTS.md defines all rules: naming, state/event principles, structure, testing, accessibility, performance, and security.
* The repo uses Alpine.js, CDN scripts only, no bundlers.
* Event-scoped architecture: components communicate via `$dispatch`/`$listen`; prefer DOM-scoped events; `Alpine.store` only for true shared domain state.
* The backend uses Go language ecosystem

## Your tasks

1. **Read AGENTS.md first** → treat it as the *authoritative style guide*.
2. **Scan the codebase** → identify violations (inline handlers, globals, duplicated strings, lack of constants, cross-component state leakage, etc.).
3. **Generate PLAN.md** → bullet list of problems and refactors needed, scoped by file. PLAN.md is a part of PR metadata. It's a transient document outlining the work on a given issue.
4. **Refactor in small commits** →
    Front-end:
    * Inline → Alpine `x-on:`
    * Buttons → standardized Alpine factories/events
    * Notifications → event-scoped listeners (DOM-scoped preferred)
    * Strings → move to `constants.js`
    * Utilities → extract into `/js/utils/`
    * Composition → normalize `/js/app.js` as Alpine composition root
    Backend:
    * Use "object-oreinted" stye of functions attached to structs
    * Prioritize data-driven solutions over imperative approach
    * Design and use shared components
5. **Tests** → Add/adjust Puppeteer tests for key flows (button → event → notification; cross-panel isolation). Prioritize end-2-end and integration tests.
6. **Docs** → Update README and MIGRATION.md with new event contracts, removed globals, and developer instructions.
7. **Timeouts**  Set a timer before running any CLI command, tests, build, git etc. If an operation takes unreasonably long without producing an output, abort it and consider a different approach. Prepend all CLI invocations with `timeout <N>s` command.

## Output requirements

* Always follow AGENTS.md rules (do not restate them, do not invent new ones).
* Output a **PLAN.md** first, then refactor step-by-step.
* Only modify necessary files.
* Descriptive identifiers, no single-letter names.
* End with a short summary of changed files and new event contracts.

**Begin by reading AGENTS.md and generating PLAN.md now.**

## Rules of engagement

Review the NOTES.md. Make a plan for autonomously fixing every item under Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance. Ensure no regressions. Ensure adding tests. Lean into integration tests. Fix every issue. Document the changes.

Fix issues one by one, working sequentially. 
1. Create a new git bracnh with descriptive name, for example `feature/LA-56-widget-defer` or `bugfix/LA-11-alpine-rehydration`. Use the taxonomy of issues as prefixes: improvement/, feature/, bugfix/, maintenace/, issue ID and a short descriptive. Respect the name limits.
2. Describe an issue through tests. 
2a. Ensure that the tests are comprehensive and failing to begin with. 
2b. Ensure AGENTS.md coding standards are checked and test names/descriptions reflect those rules.
3. Fix the issue
4. Rerun the tests
5. Repeat pp 2-4 untill the issue is fixed: 
5a. old and new comprehensive tests are passing
5b. Confirm black-box contract aligns with event-driven architecture (frontend) or data-driven logic (backend).
5c. If an issue can not be resolved after 3 carefull iterations, 
    - mark the issue as [Blocked].
    - document the reason for the bockage.
    - commit the changes into a separate branch called "blocked/<issue-id>".
    - work on the next issue from the divergence point of the previous issue.
6. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH issue is fixed and tested and covered with tests.
7. Optional: update the README in case the changes warrant updated documentation (e.g. have user-facing consequences)
8. Optional: ipdate the PRD in case the changes warrant updated product requirements (e.g. change product undestanding)
9. Optional: update the code examples in case the changes warrant updated code examples
10. Mark an issue as done ([X])in the NOTES.md after the issue is fixed: New and existing tests are passing without regressions
11. Commit and push the changes to the remote branch.
12. Repeat till all issues are fixed, and commits abd branches are stacked up (one starts from another).

Do not work on all issues at once. Work at one issue at a time sequntially.

Leave Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance sections empty when all fixes are implemented but don't delete the sections themselves.

## Issues

### Features

### Improvements

- [ ] [GR-01] Prepare a full suite of integration tests with 100% coverage of the code
- [ ] [GR-03] Have complete GDoc code coverage

### BugFixes

- [ ] [GR-02] The program hangs when laucnhed on a trivial command.
